IMPORTANT: Replace the placeholder files with your actual model files:

1. Delete this file
2. Add your plant_doctor_edge_int8.tflite model file here
3. Verify labels.txt matches your model's class count (38 classes)

The model must meet these specifications:
- Input: 1x224x224x3 UINT8 RGB
- Output: 1x38 UINT8
- Format: TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)
- Quantization: INT8

No code changes are required after replacing the files.
